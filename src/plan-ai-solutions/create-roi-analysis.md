# Create an ROI Analysis for the Proposed AI Solution for a Business Process

## Overview

A comprehensive ROI analysis provides the financial justification for AI investments and helps stakeholders make informed decisions.

## ROI Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Define the Business Process

#### Process Documentation
- Current state workflow
- Pain points and inefficiencies
- Volume metrics
- Process owner
- Stakeholders impacted

#### Example: Invoice Processing
- **Current State**: Manual data entry and approval
- **Volume**: 5,000 invoices/month
- **Time**: 15 minutes per invoice
- **Error Rate**: 5%
- **Staff**: 4 FTEs

### Step 2: Identify AI Solution

#### Solution Description
- Technology approach
- Microsoft tools/services
- Implementation scope
- Success criteria

#### Example Solution
- **Technology**: AI Builder + Power Automate
- **Capability**: Automated invoice processing
- **Scope**: 80% of invoices (standard formats)
- **Timeline**: 6-month implementation

### Step 3: Quantify Current Costs

#### Labor Costs
```
Current Labor Cost:
= FTEs × Average Salary × Burden Rate
= 4 × $50,000 × 1.3
= $260,000/year
```

#### Error Costs
```
Error Cost:
= (Invoices/month × Error Rate × Cost per Error) × 12
= (5,000 × 0.05 × $50) × 12
= $150,000/year
```

#### Delay Costs
```
Late Payment Penalties:
= Missed Early Payment Discounts + Late Fees
= $25,000/year
```

#### Total Current State Cost
```
Total = $260,000 + $150,000 + $25,000 = $435,000/year
```

### Step 4: Project Future State Costs

#### Initial Investment
```
Implementation Costs:
- Consulting: $75,000
- Development: $50,000
- Testing: $15,000
- Training: $10,000
- Change Management: $15,000
Total Initial: $165,000
```

#### Ongoing Costs (Annual)
```
Licensing:
- Power Automate (4 users): $60,000
- AI Builder capacity: $12,000
- Azure services: $8,000
Total Licensing: $80,000

Operations:
- Support (0.5 FTE): $30,000
- Maintenance: $15,000
- Monitoring: $5,000
Total Operations: $50,000

Total Annual Ongoing: $130,000
```

### Step 5: Project Benefits

#### Labor Savings
```
Automation Rate: 80%
Labor Reduction:
= 4 FTEs × 80% × $65,000 (loaded cost)
= $208,000/year
```

#### Error Reduction
```
Error Reduction: 90%
Error Savings:
= $150,000 × 90%
= $135,000/year
```

#### Speed Improvements
```
Faster Processing:
= Eliminated late fees + Captured discounts
= $25,000/year
```

#### Soft Benefits (Estimated)
```
Employee Satisfaction: $20,000
Scalability: $15,000
Total Soft Benefits: $35,000/year
```

#### Total Annual Benefits
```
Total = $208,000 + $135,000 + $25,000 + $35,000 = $403,000/year
```

### Step 6: Calculate ROI Metrics

#### Year 1 Analysis
```
Year 1 Costs:
= Initial Investment + Annual Ongoing
= $165,000 + $130,000
= $295,000

Year 1 Benefits:
= $403,000

Year 1 Net Benefit:
= $403,000 - $295,000
= $108,000

Year 1 ROI:
= ($108,000 / $295,000) × 100%
= 37%
```

#### 3-Year Analysis
```
Total 3-Year Costs:
= $165,000 + ($130,000 × 3)
= $555,000

Total 3-Year Benefits:
= $403,000 × 3
= $1,209,000

3-Year Net Benefit:
= $1,209,000 - $555,000
= $654,000

3-Year ROI:
= ($654,000 / $555,000) × 100%
= 118%
```

#### Payback Period
```
Payback = Initial Investment / (Annual Benefits - Annual Costs)
= $165,000 / ($403,000 - $130,000)
= $165,000 / $273,000
= 0.60 years (7.3 months)
```

#### Net Present Value (NPV) - 5 Years, 10% Discount Rate
```
Year 0: -$165,000
Year 1: $273,000 / 1.1 = $248,182
Year 2: $273,000 / 1.21 = $225,620
Year 3: $273,000 / 1.331 = $205,109
Year 4: $273,000 / 1.464 = $186,463
Year 5: $273,000 / 1.611 = $169,512

NPV = -$165,000 + $1,034,886 = $869,886
```

## Best Practices for ROI Analysis

1. **Be Conservative**: Use realistic, achievable numbers
2. **Include All Costs**: Don't forget hidden costs
3. **Validate Assumptions**: Check with stakeholders
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test different scenarios
5. **Track Actuals**: Measure against projections
6. **Update Regularly**: Refine as you learn more
7. **Clear Documentation**: Explain all calculations
8. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and plan for risks

## Common Pitfalls

- Overestimating benefits (80% rule: assume 80% of ideal)
- Underestimating implementation time and cost
- Ignoring change management costs
- Not accounting for learning curve
- Forgetting opportunity costs
- Poor baseline data
- Ignoring soft benefits
- No sensitivity analysis
