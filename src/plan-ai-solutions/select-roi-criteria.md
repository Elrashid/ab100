## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

### TCO Formula
```
TCO = Initial Investment + (Ongoing Costs × Years) + Hidden Costs
```

### Detailed TCO Breakdown

## ROI Calculation

### Basic ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%
```

### Net Present Value (NPV)
```
NPV = Σ (Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year) - Initial Investment
```

### Payback Period
```
Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Flow
```

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Customer Service AI Agent

**Benefits (Annual)**
- Reduced support calls: $500K (50% reduction)
- Faster resolution: $200K (30% time savings)
- Improved satisfaction: $100K (estimated value)
- **Total Annual Benefits**: $800K

**Costs**
- Initial Implementation: $250K
- Annual Licensing: $100K
- Annual Maintenance: $50K
- **Year 1 Total Cost**: $400K
- **Ongoing Annual Cost**: $150K

**ROI Calculations**
- Year 1 ROI: ($800K - $400K) / $400K = 100%
- Year 2+ ROI: ($800K - $150K) / $150K = 433%
- Payback Period: 6 months

## ROI Criteria by Stakeholder
