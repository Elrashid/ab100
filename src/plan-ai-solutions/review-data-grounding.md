# 1.1.2 Review Data for Grounding

## Overview

Data quality is crucial for AI success. Grounding refers to connecting AI models to relevant, accurate data sources. This section covers how to evaluate data across key dimensions.

## Data Quality Dimensions

### Accuracy
- Is the data correct and free from errors?
- How is data validation performed?
- What is the error rate?
- Are there data quality metrics in place?

### Relevance
- Does the data align with the business problem?
- Is the data representative of the use case?
- Are there gaps in data coverage?
- Is the data granular enough?

### Timeliness
- How current is the data?
- What is the data refresh frequency?
- Is real-time data needed?
- How is data staleness handled?

### Cleanliness
- Are there duplicate records?
- How are missing values handled?
- Is the data format consistent?
- Are there data quality rules in place?

### Availability
- Is the data accessible when needed?
- What are the access controls?
- Is the data in a usable format?
- Are there API or connectivity issues?

## Data Grounding Strategies

### Knowledge Sources
- Document libraries (SharePoint, OneDrive)
- Structured databases (SQL, Dataverse)
- Web content and APIs
- Enterprise knowledge bases

### Retrieval Methods
- Semantic search
- Vector databases
- Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Metadata filtering

## Microsoft Tools for Data Grounding

- **Dataverse**: Common Data Service for Power Platform
- **SharePoint**: Document management and knowledge sources
- **Azure AI Search**: Intelligent search and retrieval
- **Microsoft Graph**: Access to Microsoft 365 data

## Best Practices

1. Establish data quality baselines before implementation
2. Implement automated data quality checks
3. Document data lineage and sources
4. Regular data audits and refreshes
5. Test grounding with representative queries

## Common Pitfalls

- Assuming data quality without verification
- Using outdated or stale data
- Insufficient data coverage for use cases
- Poor data access controls
- Lack of data documentation
