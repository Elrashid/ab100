## Detailed Explanations

### Question 1 - Explanation
**Autonomous agents** are best suited for ticket routing because they can:
- Analyze content independently
- Make decisions based on multiple factors
- Route without human intervention
- Learn from patterns over time

Task agents are too simple (single-purpose), and prompt/response agents are conversational rather than action-oriented.

### Question 2 - Explanation
The five key dimensions for grounding data quality are:
1. **Accuracy** - Is the data correct?
2. **Relevance** - Does it relate to the use case?
3. **Timeliness** - Is it current?
4. **Cleanliness** - Is it well-formatted?
5. **Availability** - Can the AI access it?

Encryption method, database vendor, and hardware are implementation details, not quality factors.

### Question 3 - Explanation
**Centralized orchestration** is ideal when:
- Agents have dependencies
- Execution order matters
- Complex coordination needed
- Centralized monitoring required

A coordinator agent manages the workflow and ensures proper sequencing.

### Question 4 - Explanation
**Extend Microsoft 365 Copilot for Sales** because:
- Native integration with Dynamics 365
- Pre-built capabilities for sales scenarios
- Less development effort
- Microsoft support and updates
- Familiar user experience

Building custom would be more expensive and time-consuming for standard sales scenarios.

### Question 12 - Explanation
**Calculation:**
- Current monthly hours: 5,000 invoices × 10 min = 50,000 min ÷ 60 = 833 hours
- With AI:
  - Automated (80%): 4,000 × 1 min = 4,000 min
  - Manual (20%): 1,000 × 10 min = 10,000 min
  - Total: 14,000 min ÷ 60 = 233 hours
- **Savings: 833 - 233 = 600 hours**

At $30/hour = $18,000 monthly savings
