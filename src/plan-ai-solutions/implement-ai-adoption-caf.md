- Cloud adoption plan

### 3. Ready
- Azure landing zone considerations
- Design areas for AI workloads
- Identity and access management
- Network topology and connectivity
- Security baseline

### 4. Adopt
Two parallel tracks:
- **Migrate**: Migrate existing AI workloads
- **Innovate**: Build new AI solutions

### 5. Govern

- Skills gap analysis (data scientists, ML engineers)
- Infrastructure requirements (GPU compute, storage)
- Partner and vendor evaluation

### Preparing for AI
- Set up Azure AI services
- Configure Azure Machine Learning workspace
- Establish MLOps practices
- Implement data governance

## Microsoft Tools

- **Azure AI Foundry**: End-to-end AI development
- **Azure Machine Learning**: ML model training and deployment
- **Azure AI Services**: Pre-built AI capabilities
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: GPT models and deployment

## Best Practices

1. Start with a pilot project to demonstrate value
2. Build a center of excellence for AI
3. Establish clear governance from day one
4. Invest in skills development
5. Prioritize responsible AI practices
6. Plan for scale from the beginning

## Common Pitfalls
