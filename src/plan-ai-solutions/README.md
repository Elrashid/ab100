# Plan AI-powered Business Solutions (25–30%)

Planning AI-powered business solutions is a critical first step in any AI implementation. This section covers the foundational skills needed to assess requirements, design strategies, and evaluate the business case for AI solutions.

## Key Topics

This section is divided into three main areas:

1. **[Analyze Requirements](./analyze-requirements.md)**: Learn how to assess the use of agents, review data quality, and organize business solution data.

2. **[Design Overall AI Strategy](./design-strategy.md)**: Understand how to implement AI adoption processes, design multi-agent solutions, and determine when to build custom agents.

3. **[Evaluate Costs and Benefits](./evaluate-costs.md)**: Master ROI analysis, cost evaluation, and decision-making around building vs. buying AI components.

## Why This Matters

Proper planning ensures that AI investments align with business objectives, data is prepared for AI consumption, and the solution architecture is sound from the start. Poor planning can lead to:

- Failed AI implementations
- Cost overruns
- Data quality issues
- Misaligned business outcomes
- Security and compliance problems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Assess when and where to use AI agents in business processes
- Evaluate data readiness for AI implementation
- Design comprehensive AI strategies using Microsoft tools
- Conduct ROI analysis for AI solutions
- Make informed build vs. buy decisions
