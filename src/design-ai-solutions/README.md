# Design AI-powered Business Solutions (25–30%)

Designing AI-powered business solutions requires deep understanding of Microsoft's AI platforms, agent architectures, and integration patterns. This section covers the technical design aspects of AI solutions.

## Key Topics

This section is divided into three main areas:

1. **[Design AI and Agents](./design-ai-agents.md)**: Learn how to design various types of agents, customize Copilot, and apply AI services to business requirements.

2. **[Design Extensibility](./design-extensibility.md)**: Understand how to extend AI solutions using custom models, Model Context Protocol, and agent behaviors.

3. **[Orchestrate Configuration](./orchestrate-config.md)**: Master the configuration and orchestration of prebuilt agents across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365.

## Why This Matters

Good design ensures:
- Scalable and maintainable solutions
- Optimal performance and cost
- Security and compliance
- User adoption and satisfaction
- Integration with existing systems

Poor design leads to:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- High maintenance costs
- User frustration
- Failed implementations

## Design Principles

### 1. Agent-First Thinking
Design with agents as primary interaction model, not just automation scripts.

### 2. User-Centric Design
Focus on user experience and natural conversation flows.

### 3. Composability
Build reusable components that can be combined in different ways.

### 4. Security by Design
Incorporate security and compliance from the beginning.

### 5. Responsible AI
Ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability.

### 6. Performance and Scale
Design for production workloads and growth.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Design different types of agents (task, autonomous, prompt/response)
- Customize Copilot in Dynamics 365 applications
- Design extensibility using Azure AI Foundry and custom models
- Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent extensibility
- Configure and orchestrate prebuilt Microsoft agents
- Apply the Power Platform Well-Architected Framework
- Design agent flows and topics in Copilot Studio
